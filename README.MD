## Project Overview
This project is a pseudo E-Commerce website I am making with Java Spring and MySQL on the backend and React on the frontend.

### Features that have been added: <br>
-Responsive product display <br>
-Filtered product display by category (Ex: products that are listed as tools) and search bar (Ex: products that start with "ham") <br>
-Login and sign up for accounts <br>

### Features that have yet to be added: <br>
-Ability to add products to database <br>
-Ability to add categories to database <br>
-User privileges. I plan to have 3 privileges (Customer, Staff, Master). Customers or users with an account can "buy" products. Staff members can also add products to the inventory database. The Master(me) can also add categories and choose which accounts are permitted Staff privileges. <br>
-A fake money system <br>
-Pagination for product display <br>
-Product display shows a preview image if available <br>

### Product Filtration Demo <br>
This is a demo GIF that shows how the site currently looks like and highlights the filtration functionality. First it shows filtering by category, then by using the search bar, then both. <br>

### Responsiveness Demo <br>
This is a demo GIF that highlights the responsiveness of the site. The main thing to observe is how the product grid adapts to the width of the device. This is not exactly how it would be seen on on smaller devices because the fullscreen of my device was not being used but it gives an idea. <br>
