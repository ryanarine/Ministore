This project is a pseudo E-Commerce website I am making with Java Spring and MySQL on the backend and React on the frontend.

Features that have been added:
-Responsive product display
-Filtered product display by category (Ex: products that are listed as tools) and search bar (Ex: products that start with 'ham')
-Login and sign up for accounts

Features that have yet to be added:
-Ability to add products to database
-Ability to add categories to database
-User privileges. I plan to have 3 privileges (Customer, Staff, Master). Customers or users with an account can "buy" products. Staff members can also add products to the inventory database. The master(me) can also add categories and choose which accounts are permitted Staff privileges.
-A fake money system
-pagination for product display
-product display shows a preview image if available
